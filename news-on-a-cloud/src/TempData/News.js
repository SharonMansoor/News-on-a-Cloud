        "Disruption of Iranian computers, which reportedly caused more damage than described by Iranian officials, presumably in retaliation for an earlier attempted cyberattack on rural water distribution",
      body:
        "Citing unnamed U.S. and foreign government officials, the Post said the May 9 disruption of Iranian computers was presumably in retaliation for an earlier attempted cyberattack on rural water distribution systems in Israel. The Israeli Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters on the Post report. The managing director of Irans Ports and Maritime Organization, Mohammad Rastad, told Irans ILNA news agency last week that the cyberattack did not penetrate the organizations computers and was only able to infiltrate and damage a number of private operating systems. A foreign government security official said, however, the attack was highly accurate and the damage to the Iranian port was more serious than described in official Iranian accounts, according to the Post. The Post reported on May 8 that Iran was linked to the attempted cyberattack on the Israeli water network in April. The intrusion targeted several Water Authority facilities and was thwarted before significant damage was done, the Post said, citing officials familiar with the incident. Israeli cybersecurity officials gave an immediate order to all sites affected to change passwords and take steps to stop any breach of their systems while some sites were instructed to go offline. Daniel Lacker, who heads the Water Authoritys security department, reported the attack. We have received a number of reports regarding a cyberattack on the systems. No damage was reported during the incident.  The Water Authority said in response: Attempted cyberattacks are not new and are constantly addressed by experts. According to the report, the Iranian hackers used American servers to launch their attack.",

        "Health officials say waiver in place until end of week after parents threaten to close down schools if no change made to mask rules amid soaring temperatures",
      body:
        "Israel is beset by what may be one of the longest and most extreme heatwave ever recorded this week, with temperatures expected to reach around 40°C for at least the next six days.  “We need to take protecting ourselves from coronavirus seriously. But the heatwave can be as dangerous,” newly appointed Health Minister Yuli Edelstein said in a statement. “Following the advice of health authorities, I have decided to lift the requirement to wear masks as long as there are no large gatherings.” The Health Ministry said that students will not be required to wear masks at school, while staying in open areas, or in buildings without air conditioning, except for during gatherings. Several cities around the country have either canceled or threatened to cancel classes on Monday and Tuesday due to the requirement from students to wear protective face masks during the scorching heat. Education Ministry Director-General Shmuel Abuav earlier sent a letter to outgoing Health Ministry Director-General Moshe Bar Siman-Tov, saying that the obligation to wear face masks had made studying impossible and demanding to revoke the order. The Israel Pediatric Association on Monday said that school children should not be forced to wear face masks during the hot days of summer despite health regulations meant to prevent coronavirus infections. In the statement, the pediatrics association urged the health and education ministries to revoke the Health Ministry order in the wake of the unusual heatwave that hit the country on Sunday.  During this current heatwave, requiring children to wear masks for long hours is impractical and a significant burden, masks that get wet from sweat will become ineffective, read the statement. Therefore, we believe children should be exempt from wearing masks until this heatwave ends. According to the associations experts, the effectiveness of face masks in preventing coronavirus spread among children is unclear and there is no evidence in the scientific literature to support the Health Ministrys claims.

        "Police apprehend 41-year-old woman from Rishon Lezion, who reportedly suffers from mental problems; the woman's mental health worsened after surviving a deadly terror attack 18 years ago",
      body:
        "It was reported Thursday that the grave of 21-year-old First Sgt. Amit Ben Yigal, in the military cemetery in the southern region of Beer Yaakov, had been vandalized, only two days after he was buried. At the end of a four days long manhunt, police detained the 41-year-old Rishon Lezion resident, who is reportedly suffering from a mental illness. According to police, the suspect became religious and turned ultra-Orthodox after surviving a suicide bombing in Jerusalem 18 years ago, which claimed many lives. The woman began developing mental problems after the incident. Last year she was arrested for a similar incident after she desecrated the grave of her deceased husband. Police said the incident stemmed from the womans worsening mental health condition rather than a criminal or nationalist intent, as feared initially. Sources said during the police manhunt, the woman did not have her cellphone with her while and she did not contact anyone she knew, so investigators had difficulty locating the suspect. משפחתו של עמית בן יגאל מעל חלקת קברו The soldiers parents at the gravesite I feel sorry for her, said Barch, Ben Yigals father. A normal person wouldnt do such a thing. It wouldnt do me any good to get mad, whoever did this needs to get therapy. Police have obtained footage apparently showing the woman desecrating for several hours the grave of an IDF soldier, killed last week in a West Bank raid, Ynet has learned on Sunday from sources familiar with the matter. The IDF issued a statement last Thursday saying that excavation marks had been found on the gravesite, just two days after the soldiers funeral. Ben Yigal’s family was updated immediately and his father arrived at the cemetery accompanied by army officials shortly after. Military rabbinate representatives also arrived at the scene to make sure that the honor of the fallen had not been desecrated. The suspect was also arrested last year for a similar act after desecrating the grave of her deceased husband. Police have ruled out criminal or nationalist causes, as initially feared.  In light of the incident, we have decided that the grave will be sealed and Golani soldiers will guard the area,” the IDF Spokespersons Unit said. Any attack on the dignity of fallen soldiers must be condemned. The IDF and the police are working to investigate the incident, it added. Defense Ministry personnel have been guarding Staff Sergeant Amit Ben Yigals gravesite ever since we became aware of the incident, read a statement. The ministry expresses shock and disgust at the act and has been accompanying the Ben Yigal family and providing them with all the necessary support and assistance. Security forces are still conducting a manhunt for the rock thrower who killed Ben Yigal when he and his comrades were conducting arrests of four terror suspects in the village of Yabed.",

Iran, Israels arch-enemy in the Middle East, has been a key supporter, along with Russia, of President Bashar al-Assad during Syrias civil war, sending military advisers as well as material and regional Shiite militias that it backs. Israel, which monitors neighbouring Syria intensively, has carried out hundreds of air strikes in Syria targeting suspected arms and troop movements by Iran and the Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas it sponsors. Iran is significantly reducing the scope of its forces in Syria and even evacuating a number of bases, said Bennett in his valedictory address. Though Iran has begun the withdrawal process from Syria, we need to complete the work. Its in reach.  Israeli officials have suggested in the past that Israels military operations were showing signs of success. Iran, which is struggling economically under the burden of U.S. sanctions and has also been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, has repeatedly said its military presence in Syria is at the invitation of Assads government and that it will remain in Syria as long as its help is needed. A senior aide to Irans foreign minister, Ali-Ashgar Khaji, reiterated on Saturday that Tehran would continue working closely with the Assad government and Russia to combat terrorism and find a political solution to the Syrian crisis, Irans ISNA news agency reported.
